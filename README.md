# securecrt-keyword-highlighting

**New:**

Starting with SecureCRT version 9.3, the length of the regular expression for each line was increased.  

feralpacket2023.ini ( and feralpacket2024.ini ) will start using longer regular expressions.  This will allow me to do some consolidation and reduce the number of lines.  

Note, the regular expressions I had been using where up to 256 characters long.  **shrug**

From SecureCRT_HISTORY.TXT:

  > - Increased the character limit for keywords from 246 to 2048,
  >   which allows more complex regular expressions to be specified
  >  for keyword highlighting.
